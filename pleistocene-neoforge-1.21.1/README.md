# Pleistocene

Turn Minecraft into a prehistoric Ice Age adventure! Travel back in time to the dangerous yet exciting Pleistocene era. Knap flint, perform ancient rituals, and hunt majestic creatures. 

Features include: 

* New items
* New blocks
* Reworked progression
* New mechanics 
* Altered worldgen 
* New mobs (including the majestic Woolly Mammoth!)
* Integration with other mods

## Getting Started 
Start off by getting flint. Then make yourself a flint hand axe (or two--they're very fragile!). After you have your first tool, you can acquire logs. The most important thing you'll want to make after that is a fire. In the Pleistocene era, fire represents your life. Without fire, you won't survive long. 

But wait, you may ask, how will I possibly make a fire without access to stone for a furnace to get charcoal or without a crafting table to make 3x3 recipes? 

Luckily, the campfire recipe has been rewritten with realism in mind. Get two sticks and two logs. Now you can make a campfire. Don't forget to make a hand drill firestarter to light it. Now you can cook your food and even make bricks for your base or furnace. 

## New Items
Animals with fur now drop a fur pelt. It must be processed before it can be made useful; however, once processed, a world of possibilities opens up. Keep yourself warm using fur armor and make a comfortable bed so you can live your nomadic life in peace. 

Most creatures will also drop bones. Bones can be crafted into many things, some of which can be imbued with the power of the spirits. 

New tool types enhance the immersion: 
* Knife
* Scraper
* Club 
* Fishing spear 

## New Blocks
You will be using a ton of flint, so store all that flint in the flint pile. Make a 3x3 grid of flint to craft it. Decrafting the flint pile returns the 9 flint. 

There are also new crafting stations. 

* Chopping block
* Knapping station
* Drying rack 
* Altar 

New decorative blocks include wattle and daub, as well as an easier way to make mud bricks. 

## Reworked Progression 
With new tools, armors, crafting stations, and mechanics, progression is more immersive and rewarding than ever before. 

### Tools
Wooden pickaxe? Diamond tools? Netherite? That doesn't fit the vision of a Pleistocene lifestyle, so they've been disabled. 

**1: Wood and Hand tools**

Hand tools can be crafted in the 2x2 menu using raw flint and are very weak. 

**2: Flint tools** 

Flint tools must be crafted at the knapping station. First, take one raw flint and knap it to receive 3 pieces of sharpened flint, which can be used to craft stronger, sharper tools.  

**3: Bone tools**

Like sharpened flint, bone must be worked at the knapping station. Some bones are better than others. You can also experiment with replacing the sticks in some recipes with bone. 

**4: Carved bone tools** 

Rituals will come into play here. Interact with various creatures and discover the hidden magic that unites all spirits. Make a powerful enough offering to a particular spirit, and it may decide to be your totem and allow you to carve its likeness on your tools, strengthening it beyond its natural abilities... 

**5: Obsidian tools** 

Obsidian is a rare, ultra-durable material that can be found deep within caves where only the bravest and most prepared nomads dare to traverse. 

### Armor

Keep yourself warm in the cold and safe during hunts with all-new armor.

**1: Leather Armor** 

The most basic armor set can be crafted using animal hides. You will be hunting, so don't waste any part of the animal that gave its life to sustain you. 

First, get some raw hides from certain furless animals, like auruchs. Then, stretch the raw hide on the drying rack. After some time, you'll recieve leather. Using the leather, you can make your leather armor like normal.

**2: Fur Armor** 

This set of fur armor could carry you all the way into the end game, if you are careful. It's warm and fluffy. With the right imbuements, it may even be the most powerful set of armor in the game. 

To craft it, first make a fire. Then, make a kiln with clay or mud bricks. You'll need a bucket of water. Once you have your bucket, break your fire to receive ashes. Mix the ashes with water and the resulting solution can be used to prepare the furs for crafting. 

**3: Scaled Armor**

Craft the scaled bone armor set using the tough hides of dangerous reptiles. 

**4: Imbued Bone Armor** 

Imbued bones can be used to make an unpredictive armor set. 

**5: Obsidian Armor** 

The ultimate symbol of power. 

### Crafting

The crafting progression system involves making new, more difficult crafting mechanisms to make more powerful equipment, both tools and armor. Reworked or completely new crafting stations include: 

* Campfire
* Drying rack
* Chopping block
* Knapping station
* Kiln 
* Furnace

**Campfire** 

The campfire is the most important and basic crafting station. Not only can you cook food at the campfire, but you can slowly bake bricks with mud or clay which can be used to make various objects. 

**Drying Rack**

The drying rack is used to make leather, which is used for armor and advanced tools. The drying rack can also be used to turn raw meat into jerky, which is the only food you can eat without fire cooking. 

**Chopping Block** 

The chopping block is now the only way to get wood planks. You will need a chopping block before you can make a crafting table. 

**Knapping Station** 

The knapping station is made using leather and stone. Without it, you will not be able to make flint or bone tools. 

**Kiln** 

Made using bricks of mud or clay, the kiln is used to bake raw clay formed items into ceramics, such as the flower pot, storage pot, or bucket. 

It can also turn logs into charcoal. 

**Furnace** 

The furnace must now be made using regular stone, not cobblestone. 

**Crafting Station** 

The crafting station has stayed largely the same, but remember, the only way to obtain planks is with the chopping block. 

## New Mechanics

In the ancient world, every creature had a spirit and spirits were everywhere. Some were benevelont, some were hostile, but most were quite neutral. 

Spirits can be appeased with ritual offerings. If your offering impresses a spirit, it may give you special powers or protect you from malicious creatures. 

**Altar** 

The altar is crafted with stone. Present a precious item, such as diamond, and see what you receive. If you present an undesired item, such as a gravel block, you may receive a curse instead... 

If you make enough altars around your base and regularly tend to them, the spirits may even protect you from hostile animals and spirits. 

**Imbuing** 

Once you have a totem spirit, you can imbue your weapons, tools, and armor to gain supernatural abilities. 

## Altered World Generation 

Explore a hostile land of vast ice sheets and bitter cold. Warm regions are now very rare, with a less than 1% chance of spawning Badlands. 

## New Mobs 

It wouldn't be the Pleistocene era without ancient animals. The following new mobs have been added: 

* Woolly mammoth
* Woolly rhino 
* Cave bear
* Sabertooth tiger 

Hostile entities include: 

* Vengeful Spirit 
* And more...

The following mobs have been completely disabled: 

* Creeper
* Warden
* Zombie (and all variants)
* Skeleton (and all variants)

Additionally, Villagers and Pillagers have been changed to Neanderthals. 

## Mod Integration 

*Pleistocene* works best with other mods. The following mods are optional but highly recommended for the ultimate playthrough: 

* Clayworks 
* Farmer's Delight
* Various temperature mods (choose only one)
    * Survive
    * Homeostatic 
    * Tough as Nails 
* And more...
