# Pleistocene

Travel back in time to the Pleistocene era with new items, tools, mobs, and game mechanics.

Features include: 

* Comprehensive advancement tree
* New items
* New blocks
* Reworked progression
* Immersive crafting
* New mechanics
* Altered worldgen 
* New mobs (including the majestic Woolly Mammoth!)
* Integration with other mods

> **NOTE**
> 
> This mod should be installed for a new world since it alters world generation. Many vanilla recipes (i.e. metal, diamond, etc.) are disabled in order to create an immersive ice age world.

This is not your dad's Minecraft. Drop your expectations of how to play Minecraft and experience a new world with different rules. There are no creepers here, nor zombies or diamond tools. This is Pleistocene: a vast, frozen land ripe with possibility. Will you dare to hunt giant woolly mammoths? Will you build a fortress of mud bricks using nothing but the earth and grass? Will you appease the spirits with gracious offerings and harness their power? Or will you freeze to death, becoming preserved for the study of future generations? 

## Getting Started 

The mod comes with a complete Advancement tab that details all the changes and progression. If you want to play it in a spoiler-free environment, stop reading and start playing here! There are hidden advancements to look out for, too. 

The basic necessities are: 

* Flint
* Chopping block 
* Sticks
* Campfire

**First Steps** 

No more punching trees to get wood. You'll need to acquire flint and craft a hand axe. Then, chop some trees. Craft the chopping block using one log. Then, place the chopping block. Put some logs in your off-hand and your axe in your main hand, and chop away! You'll be crafting in no time. 

To get a campfire, combine two logs and two sticks in your crafting menu, place it, then light it the old-fashioned way: with just two sticks!

## New Items

New drops have been added to animals: 

* Fur 
* Bone
* Raw hide 

Animals with fur may now drop a fur pelt. It must be processed before it can be made useful; however, once processed, a world of possibilities opens up. Keep yourself warm using fur armor and make a comfortable bed so you can live your nomadic life in peace. 

Most creatures will also drop bones. Bones can be crafted into many things, some of which can be imbued with the power of the spirits.

Raw hide drops from furless animals and is processed into leather using the drying rack. 

For late game apparel, you'll want to make amethyst silk: a luxurious fabric made from fine amethyst and string. 

## New Blocks

You will be using a ton of flint, so store all that flint in the flint pile. Make a 2x2 grid of flint to craft it. Decrafting the flint pile returns the 4 flint. 

There are also new crafting stations. 

* Chopping block
* Drying rack 
* Altar 

## Reworked Progression 

With new tools, armors, crafting stations, and mechanics, progression is more immersive and rewarding than ever before. 

### Tools

Wooden pickaxe? Metal processing? Diamond tools? Netherite? That doesn't fit the vision of a Pleistocene lifestyle, so they've been disabled. 

**1: Wood and Hand tools**

Hand tools can be crafted in the 2x2 menu using raw flint and are very weak. 

**2: Flint tools** 

Flint tools must be "knapped" using a rock. Take one raw flint and a rock. Craft them together to receive 3 pieces of sharpened flint, which can be used to craft stronger, sharper tools.  

**3: Bone tools**

Like sharpened flint, bone must be knapped using a rock in the crafting menu.  

**4: Imbued bone tools** 

Make a powerful enough offering to a particular spirit, and it may decide to bless your tools, strengthening it beyond its natural abilities.

**5: Obsidian tools** 

Obsidian is a rare, ultra-durable material that can be found deep within caves where only the bravest and most prepared nomads dare to traverse. 

### Armor

Keep yourself warm in the cold and safe during hunts with all-new armor.

**1: Rawhide Armor** 

The most basic armor set can be crafted using raw animal hides, grass-woven twine, and bone. You will be hunting, so don't waste any part of the animal that gave its life to sustain you. 

**2: Leather Armor**

Leather is no longer the most basic set of armor. Great skill goes into crafting leather, and you will need to replicate that here. 

First, get some raw hides from any furless animals, like cows or pigs. Then, stretch the rawhide on the drying rack. After some time, you'll receive leather. Using the leather, you can make your leather armor like normal.

**3: Fur Armor** 

This set of fur armor could carry you all the way into the end game, if you are careful. It's warm and fluffy.  

To craft it, you'll need a bucket of water, which can be made with clay. Once you have your bucket, break your campfire to receive ashes. Mix the ashes with water and the resulting solution can be used to prepare the furs for crafting.

**4: Imbued Bone Armor** 

Imbued bones can be used to make an unpredictive armor set. 

**5: Obsidian Armor** 

The ultimate symbol of power. 

### Crafting

The crafting progression system is more immersive than ever before! Reworked or completely new crafting stations include: 

* Campfire
* Drying rack
* Chopping block

**Campfire** 

The campfire is the most important and basic crafting station. Not only can you cook food at the campfire, but you can slowly bake bricks with mud or clay which can be used to make various objects. 

**Drying Rack**

The drying rack is used to make leather, which is used for armor and advanced tools. The drying rack can also be used to turn raw meat into jerky, which is the only food you can eat without fire cooking. 

**Chopping Block** 

The chopping block is now the only way to get wood planks. You will need a chopping block before you can make a crafting table.

**Furnace** 

The furnace must now be made using regular stone, not cobblestone. 

**Crafting Station** 

The crafting station has stayed largely the same, but remember, the only way to obtain planks is with the chopping block. 

## New Mechanics

In the ancient world, every creature had a spirit and spirits were everywhere. Some were benevolent, some were hostile, but most were quite neutral. 

Spirits can be appeased with ritual offerings. If your offering impresses a spirit, it may give you special powers. 

**Altar** 

The altar is crafted with the finest stripped logs. Present a precious item and see what you receive. If you present an undesired item, you may receive a curse instead... 

## Altered World Generation 

Explore a hostile land of vast ice sheets and bitter cold. Warm regions are now very rare, with a less than 1% chance of spawning. 

Given that this mod contains a whole new world generation instruction set, you must start a new world to see it in effect. 

## New Mobs 

It wouldn't be the Pleistocene era without ancient animals. The following new mobs have been added: 

* Woolly mammoth

The following vanilla mobs have been completely disabled by default, but this can be turned off via the config: 

* Creeper
* Warden
* Zombie (and all variants)
* Skeleton (and all variants)
* Enderman 
* Witch, Pillager, etc.

## Mod Integration 

*Pleistocene* works best with other mods. The following mods are optional but highly recommended for the ultimate playthrough: 

* This Rocks!
* Colorful Allays 
* Brick furnace 
* Farmer's Delight
* Homeostatic
* Serene Seasons
* Clayworks
